The bandwidth aware protocol is a module for PeerSim simulator.

This module is useful to simulate real networks with bandwidth knowledge;
it implements a priority sharing bandwidth allocation which servers the
transmissions with FIFO policies, reserving as much resources as possibile
for each connection. The amount of data to transmit is given in bits,
and when a transmission is feasible it returns the time needed to perform
the transfer in milliseconds, otherwise it returns a code reflecting the
lack of either upload or download bandwidth. These error codes are in
the BandwidthMessage class, and the module that uses this protocol has to
know these codes.
