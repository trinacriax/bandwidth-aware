The bandwidth aware protocol is a module for PeerSim simulator.
The author is Alessandro Russo (DISI - University  of Trento),
and this module was written under Napa-Wine project (www.napa-wine.eu)
For further information please mail the author.

This module is useful to simulate real networks with bandwidth knowledge;
it implements a priority sharing bandwidth allocation which servers the
transmissions with FIFO policies, reserving as much resources as possibile
for each connection. The amount of data to transmit is given in bits,
and when a transmission is feasible it returns the time needed to perform
the transfer in milliseconds, otherwise it returns a code reflecting the
lack of either upload or download bandwidth. These error codes are in
the BandwidthMessage class, and the module that uses this protocol has to
know these codes.

How to compile.

1) Place the parent directory (bandwidth-aware) in the same parent direnctory of PeerSim simulator:

.
..
peersim
bandwidth-aware
myFirstProtocol
myFavoriteOne

2) copy you version of peersim.jar, djep and jep in the bandwidth-aware direcotry

3) Use the Makefile

run make

java -cp "peersim.jar:djep-1.0.0.jar:jep-2.3.0.jar:bandwidth-aware.jar" peersim.Simulator config-bandwidth.txt > output.log

look at output.log
